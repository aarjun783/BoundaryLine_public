# Boundary Line
API for grabbing Cricket related data from various sources.

Cricket data is not available publicly and there are several enthusiasts who reinvent the wheel replicating each others' 
efforts to get data and build analytical tools and models on top of it. While some of this should still happen as it encourages novel approaches
& research and because that is how science works, doing so in a coordinated fashion as a community will open up collaboration channels, free up
bandwidth and resources for current contributors to contribute in a more impactful way to the sport, and lower the barrier for entry for new folks
who want to contribute with the unique skills that they have in visualization, design, front end dev, databases, sports strategy, simulations and other
as yet unimagined areas.

TBD: Extend this effort to maintaining an open source database so the scraping runs are non-redundant as well.
TBD: This repo can also be used for modeling, analytics and other related items
